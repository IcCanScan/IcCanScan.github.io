# CanScan

Welcome to our home page! Our mission is to make sure smart contracts on the Internet Computer are safe enough, we provide materials around this mission.

Additionally, we offer our services for auditing your Rust smart contracts, unfortunately, the Motoko language is still young and we do not want to claim any expertise in that domain just yet.

Reach out on discord `canscan#1566` or via email at `canscan@proton.me`.
